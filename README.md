# Hull breach Tracking

## Description
This project features a dynamic physics engine, which simulates breaches in a ship's hull, and the many ways of detecting them finding their location through mechanical wave analysis.

## Context

This project was meant to be completed by june 2020, as part of the french TIPE oral exams (Concours d'admission aux Grandes Ã‰coles). However, due to the COVID crisis, [these were cancelled](https://major-prepa.com/actualite/concours-2020-grandes-ecoles-explications/#:~:text=La%20d%C3%A9cision%20du%20Chapitre%20des,des%20pr%C3%A9parationnaires%20que%20des%20%C3%A9tudiants.). Consequently, there was no point carrying on the development process, hence the unfinished work.
